# Amia Program Beneficiaries

## What's in the App

The application is build using Vue and Firebase.
Vue handles the user interface while Firebase handles the backend services the UI needs.

## Technologies Used

- [Vue 2](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)
- [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

## What's in the repository

The repository contains a **client** folder is the codebase for the user interface/front end.
Since the application connects to a serverless backend using Firebase, there's no codebase for the backend.

If in the future the application is to be extended and use a different architecture for the backend, that codebase can be placed on the level of the **client** folder.

└── client
└── (backend folder if chose a different architecture for the backend)
